This repository provides a solution for processing a 3D point cloud dataset. The code handles filtering junk points, removing ground points, performing clustering on the remaining points, and visualizing the results in 3D.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x

- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for clustering
  - `matplotlib` for visualization

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
